career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I have been working in a full stack capacity for 3 years and on the front end for 6 total. I work for a small company where I am required to wear a lot of hats, my duties can span from tech support, 
      to marketting but focus on web development. I am the person everyone comes to when they don't understand something or something goes wrong. I keep everything running smoothly, nothing is "above my pay grade". 
      I maintain and develop the front end and the backend, manage the server using ubuntu and a reverse proxy and am constantly extending features specifically integration and tracking systems. I manage a small 
      database and a number of cron jobs to help meet the unique needs of the company.

#      I've spent six years working in development and tech and in that time I've had to adapt a lot and wear many hats. I've worked with both client and server side code in some detail as well as a diverse range
#      of tasks needed to keep a web based company funcitonal and competitive in the current market. Recently I decided to aquire a Master's degree in physics and took the opportunity to also focus on machine learning
#      quantum computing and even the 2 in combination, as was a major topic in my thesis. I am ready for a new challenge leveraging my coding background and new machine learning knowledge to be a powerful asset to
#      your team!
