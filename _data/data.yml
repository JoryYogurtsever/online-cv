career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I have been working in a full stack capacity for 3 years and on the front end for 6 total. I work for a small company where I am required to wear a lot of hats, my duties can span from tech support, to marketting but focus on web development. I am the person everyone comes to when they don't understand something or something goes wrong. I keep everything running smoothly, nothing is "above my pay grade". I maintain and develop the front end and the backend, manage the server using ubuntu and a reverse proxy and am constantly extending features specifically integration and tracking systems. I manage a small database and a number of cron jobs to help meet the unique needs of the company.
