career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I have been working as a web developer for 6 years. I work for a small company where I am required to wear a lot of hats. 
      I have been maintaining and developing the front end and the backend, managing the server using ubuntu and a reverse proxy and constantly extending features specifically integration and tracking systems. I've also been working closely with colleagues to provide a diverse range of technical support. I'm eager to explore new positions where I can put to use my programming and scientific abilities.

#      I've spent six years working in development and tech and in that time I've had to adapt a lot and wear many hats. I've worked with both client and server side code in some detail as well as a diverse range
#      of tasks needed to keep a web based company funcitonal and competitive in the current market. Recently I decided to aquire a Master's degree in physics and took the opportunity to also focus on machine learning
#      quantum computing and even the 2 in combination, as was a major topic in my thesis. I am ready for a new challenge leveraging my coding background and new machine learning knowledge to be a powerful asset to
#      your team!
